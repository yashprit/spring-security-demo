# Spring Security Demo

## Overview
While implementing Spring Security on one of my project, I found some good project but lack in explaining core concept. This demo contains end to end solution using spring security backend and angular2 as frontend. There are 2 parts to this demo using same source code

- Java based web application

With this sample project I would like to put focus on 
- Core Concept
- Multiple Authentication using below concept
  - Basic Http Authentication
  - JWT Authentication
  - Spring Security Architecture
